üõ†Ô∏è ***Summary of the Process***

My goal was to do a scrolly story that feels like a walk through parks. I wanted to introduce the largest NYC parks to the audience. 

Steps I followed:

1. Collected data from the NYC Parks website.
2. Researched facts, history, and trivia about each park featured.
3. Found photos from open-license sources like Pexels and Wikimedia Commons.
4. Edited original footage from Central Park. The videos were something I had filmed during my everyday walks/runs at the park.
3. Built charts and maps with Datawrapper.
4. Wrote the narrative.
5. Designed the page using HTML/CSS to create a simple but immersive scroll-based layout.


üíª ***Tech Used***

- HTML / CSS ‚Äì For page structure and styling
- Final Cut Pro ‚Äì For editing the video
- Datawrapper ‚Äì For creating maps and charts
- Numbers ‚Äì For early data exploration and notes
- GitHub Pages ‚Äì To host the final piece

üå≥ ***About the Project***

This project began with some super ambitious goals: I wanted to visit multiple New York City parks and film video interviews with people enjoying them. I had a weekend booked for my big park tour ‚Äî but then it rained the whole time. After that, life got in the way, and I didn‚Äôt manage to find time for visiting in parks. Since my main goal was to improve my skills with scrollytelling rather than in photography, I had to move forward in the process in the order to get forward in time.

I sourced visuals from Pexels and Wikimedia Commons, and built a scrollytelling piece using those images alongside thoughtful text and simple data visualizations. The final story aims to feel like a sunny walk through the parks, where each scroll reveals a new part of the journey ‚Äî both visual and narrative.

This was my first attempt at combining video, text, data, and images into one scrollytelling piece. While it‚Äôs not exactly what I had in mind at the start, I learned a lot about what‚Äôs needed to make this kind of story come to life.

One piece of original footage did make it in: the top video is from Central Park, filmed on my phone and edited in Final Cut Pro. I had to compress it quite a bit to meet GitHub‚Äôs file size limits ‚Äî but next time, I‚Äôll explore hosting video on YouTube or Vimeo for better quality and playback.


‚úèÔ∏è ***Lessons Learned /  To-Do / Future Improvements***

What did I learn from my mistakes:
- Always have a backup plan for weather-dependent shoots. 
- Hosting large videos on GitHub is not possible.
- Scrollytelling requires thoughtful pacing: images, data, and narrative need to work as a team.

How this could be improved:
- I could Upload the Central Park video to YouTube and embed the HD version
- Doing interviews with park visitors and include their voices in the piece
- Replace stock photos with original photography
- Make the maps better and adding more details about the parks
- Make the layout more responsive on mobile
