*** ABOUT THE PROJECT ***

For this project, I had some super ambitious goals — I wanted to visit all these parks and film video interviews with people visiting them.
Unfortunately, the weekend I had booked for my big park tour ended up being rainy, and after that, I never found the time to do it. So, I ended up using photos from Pexels and Wikimedia Commons instead.

My main focus was to build a nice-looking scrollytelling piece, combining beautiful images, thoughtful text, and a visual narrative where the story moves forward through both photos and writing. This was my very first time trying something like this, and I think it’s a good start.

Since I had a lot of footage from Central Park, the top video is from my own material, edited in Final Cut Pro. Unfortunately, I didn’t know how to upload a large video to GitHub, so I had to scale it down to meet GitHub’s limits. Along the way, I also learned that I could maybe use YouTube to host videos instead of uploading them directly — but I didn’t have time to set that up for this project.

So, the truth is, I didn’t create exactly the piece I had originally envisioned — but I learned so much, and now I know what I need to figure out next time to actually pull off a project like this.
